When I was a teenager me and some friends were obsessed with Sonic. We would play Sonic games in the woods & in the playground a school, we were not cool. We even designed levels and came up with new characters for games we hoped we might one day make.

Skip forward some 30 years and I find myself with time and some skills in programming, so I’m going to have a stab at web development. I won’t be making Sonic games, but I’m going to learn what I can. I’ve been working through some tutorials and getting started with the basics. It’s not line anything I’ve done before and I’m excited to write about what I learn along the way. I hope as my kids grow it will be fun to make games with them. I have no illusions of ever making any money off this. It’s purely a way to learn something new and have some fun along the way.

I’m landed on using Godot as my tool of choice, it’s open source and runs on my computer well enough. I’ll be starting simply with 2D games and seeing what I can build. I may also get to look at making some of the art work in time but for now there’s plenty of free resources out there to get started with.
