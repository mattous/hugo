I’m Matt Hardy, I live in Leeds, West Yorkshire with my wife & 2 children.

# Work

Since 2010, I’ve been working for the debt counselling [Christians Against Poverty](https://capuk.org). I’ve had various roles in the IT department but the majority of my time there has been as a Linux Systems Admin focusing on DevOps type work. I write about what I do here sometimes.
